The secure hash algorithm or SHA is a set of cryptographic hash functions. A hash function is a type of mathematical function which turns data into a fingerprint of that data called a hash. Itâ€™s like a formula or algorithm which takes the input data and turns it into an output of a fixed length, which represents the fingerprint of the data. The algorithm can be used to encrypt data so that the resulting output will be completely indistinguishable from the original data. This makes it very difficult to determine the input even if you know the output.
 

A message or data is processed by blocks of 512 = 16 Ã— 32 bits, each block requiring 64 rounds.

## Specifications
This program was created on a [google cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) virtual machine running [Debian GNU/Linux 9](https://www.debian.org/) operating system with the [Vi text editor](https://www.vim.org/download.php) installed.

## Basic operations
1. Boolean operations AND, XOR and OR, denoted by ^,  and _, respectively.
2. Bitwise complement, denoted by Â¯.
3. Integer addition modulo 232, denoted by A + B.

Each of them operates on 32-bit words. For the last operation, binary words are interpreted as
integers written in base 2.

1. RotR(A, n) denotes the circular right shift of n bits of the binary word A.
2. ShR(A, n) denotes the right shift of n bits of the binary word A.
3. AkB denotes the concatenation of the binary words A and B.

### Functions and constants
The algorithm uses the functions:
1. Ch(X, Y,Z) = (X ^ Y )  (X ^ Z),
2. Maj(X, Y,Z) = (X ^ Y )  (X ^ Z)  (Y ^ Z),
3. (X) = RotR(X, 2)  RotR(X, 13)  RotR(X, 22),
4. 1(X) = RotR(X, 6)  RotR(X, 11)  RotR(X, 25),
5. 0(X) = RotR(X, 7)  RotR(X, 18)  ShR(X, 3),
6. 1(X) = RotR(X, 17)  RotR(X, 19)  ShR(X, 10),
and the 64 binary words Ki given by the 32 first bits of the fractional parts of the cube roots of the first
64 prime numbers:

## Padding
To ensure that the message1 has length multiple of 512 bits:
â€¢ first, a bit 1 is appended,
â€¢ next, k bits 0 are appended, with k being the smallest positive integer such that l + 1 + k  448
mod 512, where l is the length in bits of the initial message,
â€¢ finally, the length l < 264 of the initial message is represented with exactly 64 bits, and these bits
are added at the end of the message.
The message shall always be padded, even if the initial length is already a multiple of 512.

## Block decomposition
For each block M 2 {0, 1}512, 64 words of 32 bits each are constructed as follows:
â€¢ the first 16 are obtained by splitting M in 32-bit blocks
M = W1kW2k Â· Â· Â· kW15kW16
â€¢ the remaining 48 are obtained with the formula:
Wi = 1(Wiâˆ’2) +Wiâˆ’7 + 0(Wiâˆ’15) +Wiâˆ’16, 17  i  64.

## Running the program
1. Compile the program using the command. ( gcc -o sha256 sha256.c )
2. Run the program using the command. ( ./sha256 < name-of-file-here > e.g. (./sha256 test ))
    
The output should look like this for test file containing the string. 

"This is a test file for the secure hash algorithm 256". 

Hash value of file is:
